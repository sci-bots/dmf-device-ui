dmf-device-ui
=============

`dmf-device-ui` is a graphical user interface to control a digital
microfluidics control system (such as the MicroDrop/DropBot system described in
detail in [Fobel et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 102, 193513 (2013)][2]).

If you use this software in work that you publish, please cite as appropriate.

Installation
============

## Automatic installation ##

The `dmf-device-ui` package is a dependency of the `dmf_device_ui_plugin`
MicroDrop plugin, and will be installed automatically if the
`dmf_device_ui_plugin` plugin is installed.

## Manual installation ##

    pip install --find-links http://192.99.4.95/wheels --trusted-host 192.99.4.95 dmf-device-ui

The `--find-links` and `--trusted-host` are required to provide binary Gtk2
dependencies as wheels.  Visit http://192.99.4.95/wheels to browse the
contents.

The wheels server at `192.99.4.95` is maintained by Christian Fobel

Usage
=====

The `dmf-device-ui` GUI will be launched automatically from MicroDrop if the
`dmf_device_ui_plugin` plugin is installed.
